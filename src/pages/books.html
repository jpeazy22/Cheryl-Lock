        <p class="cs-text">In this delightfully hand-illustrated picture book, kids learn a valuable lesson about making the most of the situations we're given. Children will also learn about the different habitats for the animals that live in the old brown bar at the end of the street. They'll discover some of the different ways that we can live harmoniously with the world around us, and what we can do to help preserve the nature that is all around us.</p>
