                <li class="cs-text">Grace couldn’t rest without her. “No, Mom, that wasn’t a yawn!”</li>
                <li class="cs-text">By noon, Mom called Grace to change. Her wet bathing suit was getting itchy.</li>
                <li class="cs-text">Then it was time for breakfast. Grace wanted chocolate. Dad said pancakes.</li>
                <li class="cs-text">Grace sat with Caterpillar (and her two sisters). They compromised on what to make.</li>

        <p class="cs-text">
            CHERYL LOCK has known since the third grade when she read Robert C. O’Brien’s Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH that writing — and writing children’s books, more specifically — would be in her future. Eventually, she moved to Manhattan to follow her writing dreams, working for newspapers, magazines, and websites. Although this is her first children’s book, her work has been published in The New York Times, The Washington Post, Forbes, Parents, and loads of other places. She lives in Colorado with her husband and three daughters.
