The students absolutely loved the book!! The story itself was not only so adorable and kept the kids engaged, but it also inspired students to write their own stories. Cheryl explained that this story happened in real life and that's where a lot of stories can come from. She encouraged students to find their voice to write and share with the world and this book is a great example of a story coming to life!"</p>

        <p class="cs-text">
            CHERYL LOCK has known since the third grade when she read Robert C. O’Brien’s Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH that writing — and writing children’s books, more specifically — would be in her future. Eventually, she moved to Manhattan to follow her writing dreams, working for newspapers, magazines, and websites. Although this is her first children’s book, her work has been published in The New York Times, The Washington Post, Forbes, Parents, and loads of other places. She lives in Colorado with her husband and three daughters.
