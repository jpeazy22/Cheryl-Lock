		<span class="cs-topper">About Me</span>
		<h2 class="cs-title">Writer. Editor. Content Creator.</h2>
		<p class="cs-text">I graduated from James Madison University with a major in journalism and minors in both biology and American Studies. 
			I've worked for newspapers, magazines, websites and everything in between.
		</p>
		<p class="cs-text">After starting my career in Manhattan I moved to Denver, where I currently live with my husband, Chris, and our daughters Lotte, Grace and Emilia.
			Chris and I met at a Gypsy punk band concert on New Year's Eve of 2007, and we got engaged at a concert for the same Gypsy punk band on New Year's Eve of 2011.
		</p>
		<p class="cs-text">I was born in Germany and have lived in places all up and down the east coast. My work has appeared in <em>The New York Times, 
			Real Simple, Woman's Day, Runner's World, Forbes, Parents, The St. Augustine Record</em> and much more.
		</p>
		<p class="cs-text">My stories have also been syndicated all over the Web. A few examples include, <em>Business Insider</em> and <em>USA Today</em>.
		</p>
		<p class="cs-text">In my last staff job I worked at <em>LearnVest</em>, a women's financial website, where I launched the inaugural parenting section. My job was to pitch and manage all ideas, 
			create the monthly calendar for daily newsletters and write and/or edit all content relating to the newsletter and blog. I also wrote the 10-day Baby 
			on Board email newsletter, which guided parents through everything they need to do to get their finances in order before Baby arrives. I also helped 
			foster a syndication partnership between <em>LearnVest</em> and Parents and acted as the voice or talent for <em>LearnVest</em> in multimedia situations, to include 
			radio spots and videos. 
		</p>
		<p class="cs-text">In addition to the magazine and website work I've done, I've also provided content and/or advertorials for corporate clients including <em>Ameriprise, H&R Block, 
			Procter & Gamble, Luxottica</em> and <em>U.S. Cellular</em>, among others. You can view my full resume <a href="/resume">here</a>, or <a href="/contact">email me</a> to chat.
