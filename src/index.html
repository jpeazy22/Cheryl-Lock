		  My stories have been printed in national publications like <em>The New York Times, Real Simple, Parents, Runner's World, Family Circle, Woman's Day</em> and <em>Ladies' Home Journal</em>.

      <p class="cs-text">
         In my capacity as a journalist I've attended city hall meetings and interviewed candidates for local government. I've written essays about my involvement selling Mary Kay products for <em>LearnVest</em> and <em>HuffPost</em> and about my experience as a "professional marathon spectator" (self appointed) watching my husband complete the six World Marathon Majors for <em>Runner's World</em>. I've watched injured manatees get returned to the wild after being rehabilitated, interviewed world-renowned chefs and spoken with CFPs about how women can take better control of their finances.
      </p>
	  <p class="cs-text">
		  Besides writing for magazines, newspapers and websites, I've also worked on branded and advertorial content for clients like <em>Chase, Voya, John Hancock, H&R Block, U.S. Cellular</em> and the <em>National Sleep Foundation</em>.
      </p>
	  <p class="cs-text">
		   I have also worked as a syndication and SEO specialist to help sites grow in their visibility and reach.
